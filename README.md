# environmental-monitor
full spectrum environmental monitoring module 

a open source mobile solar powered with battery back up internet connected whole environmental monitor.
the idea is to make and deploy these sensors in a net grid to allow a more percise and cognitative view of the weather and environmental conditions that exist on a micro scale that when connected as a whole provide a more consise and precise view (macro) of current environmental effects of weather, construction, industrial, and residential pollution in order to inform communities and individuals about unseeable pollutants and weather conditions that effect our daily lives and to allow the public to take actions to minimize the cost and toll it takes on our lives
it is ment to hold US all accountable in our daily lives for the wear and tear we put on not only ourselves but the environment and everyone and thing around us
hopefully it will allow humans to see the damage and to correct it where we can to protect not only ourselves but animals and the environment as well.
